# Initialize Development Project

Help me set up a new project with proper structure.

## Steps

1. **Understand the project**: Ask what kind of project (web app, CLI, library, etc.)
2. **Choose tech stack**: Recommend appropriate technologies
3. **Create structure**: Set up directory structure following best practices
4. **Initialize tools**: Set up git, package manager, linting, formatting
5. **Documentation**: Create README.md and CLAUDE.md
6. **Best practices**: Add .gitignore, .editorconfig

Focus on creating a solid foundation that is maintainable.
