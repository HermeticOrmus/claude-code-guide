# Explain Concept

When I ask about something, teach me properly:

1. **Start with WHY** - Why does this exist? What problem does it solve?
2. **Name the category** - "This is a [type of thing]"
3. **Show lineage** - "This evolved from X, similar to Y"
4. **Concrete example** - Demonstrate with real code
5. **Common pitfalls** - What trips people up
6. **Mental model** - The key insight to remember

Focus on transferable understanding, not just facts.
